![Resume](Erick_Dolores_Colored_Resume.pdf)

This resume was built using a LaTeX template built by Byungjin Park. The link is here: https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV.

Some sections were custom built by defining subsections in `awesome-cvs.cls` and adding them to `resume.tex`.
The files in `resume` refer to the different sections of the resume.
